X-Wing series 60FPS (1.0.2) patch by Justagai

This will change the FPS limit from 30 to 60 in any of the X-Wing games in the series: X-Wing, TIE Fighter, X-Wing vs TIE Fighter, Balance of power and X-Wing Alliance

Compatible with the Disc, GoG and Steam versions.


Instructions: Extract/Move dinput.dll and Hook_60FPS.dll into the game folder.

Multiplayer: Make sure that everyone has the same patch installed to prevent syncing issues.

Notes: 

- If there is a frame loss when targeting something and you have a custom DDRAW installed, try turning off antialiasing in its config.

Issues:

- It is possible that 60FPS can make some missions impossible due to a movement bug in the engine. Please report the mission with the bugged craft.

Changelog:
